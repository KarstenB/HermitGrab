The TUI should allow the user to inspect existing profiles on the left, and the currently active tags on the right. While only one profile can be selected, on the right all tags are listed as checkbox, and selecting a profile updates the list of active tags. 

The user has the option to manually select and deselect tags.

Below the split-plan is the execution plan listed which also updated whenever an tag is selected.

Finally the user can press execute, the previous screen is replaced by a new one that shows the execution plan that is updated with a checkbox when the action is executed, and a progress bar at the bottom. 

When the execution plan is finished, the user has the option to scroll through the execution plan and inspect details of the action like standard output, if available.
